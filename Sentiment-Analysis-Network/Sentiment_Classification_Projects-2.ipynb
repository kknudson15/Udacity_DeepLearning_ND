       " 'i have to admit i have always found it difficult to watch an antonioni film from start to finish at the first try  and even for this one  i ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions . in the end  i realised perhaps it was better that way  because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one .  br    br   the first part seems a lot more fragmentary  which is not a bad thing  it just requires more of an effort to follow . when it gets to the desert scenes  all efforts are repaid in full . the stunning cinematography is only a part of it  what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence  the silence and vastness of it  the sense of sadness and freedom  the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters . the desert is dead  but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part . the dance between the airplane flying over and the girl  s car makes for a series of great shots . the love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful  it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times . there is of course something very stylish and studied about them  but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural  spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days . it all feels loose and unscripted  thanks also to the understated acting   but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form  which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end  a really mesmerising spectacle . it just leaves you in awe .  br    br   i don  t really care for some the usual objections boring  well  yes  it is  if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists  but then if all cinema was like that  that would be truly dull and sad pretentious  maybe  but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills  depth  and style  pretentious is a compliment . the  political  criticisms make the least sense to me  i don  t see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse  patriotic requirements . it just defeats the purpose . perhaps it  s true that  like a previous commenter remarked  antonioni viewed these young  hippies  and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner  but i think that adds something rather than detracting from the film . it  s not true that hippies did not exist in italy at the time  think of the    protests  like in france   although they were obviously different from the american counterpart and in some ways even more militant . but his interest in this film was not narrowly political . the events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal  timeless quality .  br    br   a special mention for the fantastic soundtrack . amongst other things  this film  along with easy rider  is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary  artsy  music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own  but unlike the former  it uses music in a much more subtle way  blending it with the landscape rather than the action .  br    br   if you want traditional narrative in a film  then don  t bother . if you want to be stunned  be patient and you won  t regret it .

       " 'well where to start here  straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma . had this film come out of italy in  say       been directed by ruggero deodatto and starred david hess  then i  d be lapping it up faster than labrador drinks water on a summer  s day . because whilst tarantino and rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema  dan reed has produced a rape  revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in england  and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken rodriguez to turn rose mcgowan  s leg into a machine gun . because if you want to play grindhouse bingo  then let me call out the  numbers    br    br    . rich  high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and  equally implausibly  gets the hots for him . check .  br    br    . gratuitous shots of said high  flying career woman in various states of nudity . check .  br    br    . convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in . check .  br    br    . unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape . check .  br    br    . gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off . bingo   br    br   plotwise  straightheads is pretty basic stuff dyer meets anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss . on the way home  they upset three locals in a landover who take their revenge by giving dyer a good shoeing and gang raping anderson . the couple then set about getting their revenge . so far  so  straw dogs    late night trains    house on the edge of the park    i spit on your grave  etc etc . so why didn  t i think much of this film  a number of reasons i suppose first off  having the likes of gillian anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better  but it  s the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most .  br    br   because whenever anyone sits down to watch hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the    s  then they always know exactly what they are getting  low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator . the baddies terrorise and murder the goodies  the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back  and everyone goes home satisfied  their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored .  br    br   as writer and director however  dan reed clearly believes straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that  and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there . for instance  when anderson and dyer are planning revenge on their attackers  they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen  year  old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with . when anderson finally meets him face to face  he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter    the casual and audacious way that reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw  dropping  it  s almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience  s moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they  ve just sat through something of significance . to make sure we  get it   at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time  ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter  but reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of anderson rough  handled and raped across the bonnet of her car . gratuitous does not enter into it .  br    br   after being told his reasons for raping her  anderson ties him over a table  rams the business end of a sniper rifle  complete with bulky silencer  just in case anyone wasn  t clear on the phallic imagery  up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger  telling dyer  who has no such moral qualms  that  it  s over  . dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that wittgenstein and russell may have discussed in their rooms back at cambridge over tea and cakes . it is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness .  br    br   in fairness  ms anderson acts her guts out throughout the film . it  s obvious she wants to leave scully far behind and  bless her  she certainly does that one wonders what mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun  dyer  on the other hand  does what he  s done in virtually every film he  s made to date  that is  plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin  a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching . this is particularly true at the closing scene where  after murdering his assailants in cold blood  dyer gazes at the camera in  what i  m sure is meant to be  a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome  but instead is far more reminiscent of oliver hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after stan has landed him in yet another fine mess . which incidentally  sums up this film quite nicely .

i was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head  y  almost psychological  but not psychological thriller  novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn  t read the novel  and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had . the book is a complex reflection of society  women  and modern life  and i was interested to see how they used the  different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film . what they actually did was a crime .  br    br   the biggest error and confusing issue is why would oxygen  a network that advertises as being for women  take an amazing book about how complex  wonderful  and terrible women are and can be  and change the protagonist from  women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story  it seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask roz  tony  and charis about how they knew zenia and in doing that  they rushed through bulk of the book . in doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it  aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with . in the film  these women aren  t people  they are characters .  br    br   in the book zenia does fake her death  but the book mentions it to get this point across  while the film wastes      minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use . they tried to make this complex book an episode of law and order or csi .  br    br   it turns out that mary louise parker played zenia  which was so wrong . zenia is a catherine zeta  jones  angelina jolie  or maybe even a scarlett johnasson type . she is a woman men can  t not adore  and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by  but in a  keep your enemies closer  kind of way . and once she gets closer  she seems totally genuine and trust worthy  despite your better judgment . she  s the kind of woman who  even when she loses  she wins she  s always still beautiful  still rich  and there are always still people out there who don  t know her game .  br    br   in the film  zenia didn  t take charis  s man  the blonde american draft dodger who was using charis in the first place . . .  but instead took august and tried to become her legal guardian  and apparently came back to be her lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies  . and zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with august  but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed . it  s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book  but i think had i not read the book  i would have spent the whole movie confused  if i had bothered to stick with it at all .  br    br   and roz  s husband was dead before zenia came in to the picture  which was weird since zenia took roz  s business and home life in the book  which is why roz hated her so much  and she and zenia had conspired to kill roz  s husband years and years back . and according to the film tony and west had been dating forever . . . even at the party where zenia and west  in the book  had painted the whole place black and they made tony seem like this totally with it  and evil  bitchy  person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it . tony  s character was so wrong in this film . . . she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky  mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book . the film basically implied smart women are evil  beautiful women are evil  powerful women are evil  and women who teach yoga are off their rockers .  br    br   they basically tried to make it so zenia wasn  t necessarily as awful as she was in the book  and then  in the end  the three women convince this former cop  who  of course in the process of researching this  meets zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to barbados or something ridiculous  which of course zenia bails on  to hide zenia  s body  which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at  but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony  or they conspired together to do it . . .  and then zenia also managed to take all of roz  s money in the process . by the end of the film i was only half paying attention between commercials b  c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been .  br    br   if you aren  t confused by this breakdown of the film  then maybe you would like it  because i have read the book and seen the movie  and from the movie alone i am ridiculously confused . it was terrible . i get that making a film out of that book is quite a task  but if you are going to take on the task  you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary  instead of creating some useless character to be our alice in wonderland .  br    br   are there really no fluffier books that oxygen could be making at least half decent tv movies of   ': 209,\n",

       " 'in the previews   the   year  old virgin  boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a    ish lonely guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn  t . too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely . and then the unexpected happens he falls in love . what  s more  there  s a movie out about it  and it  s called  the   year  old virgin .   br    br   the virgin of the title is andy stitzer  steve carell   who is indeed    works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures  which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see . he has a lovely home theater system and watches  survivor  with his two kind elderly neighbors . he  s a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women .  br    br   now here  s the real novelty with this picture it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute  mature fashion . this is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers . it could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low . sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community  which are  in no way  meant to be taken as gay  bashing   as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game   mortal kombat deception   no less  the ultimate testosterone  driven fightfest for guys  .  br    br   as someone who is rapidly approaching    collects mcfarlane toys action figures and has himself never done the deed  i found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar  themed movie could never have been . i was able to relate to the character of andy stitzer more than anyone in the theater because i was the only teenager present at this showing everyone else looked like they were all past   . a bit arrogant  i know  but would you   you  is italicized  still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of  the   year  old virgin    br    br   of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with  morning rise   don  t ask   and he  s pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex . when it  s first discovered andy is a virgin  at    his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david  paul rudd   jay  romany malco  and cal  seth rogen  all at first assume he  s gay because he  s never been with a woman  which couldn  t be any further from the truth . the truth is  andy loves women  but past traumatic experiences  revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence  have put him on the sidelines for good .  br    br   david  jay  and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid  so help them all . but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster  as proved by one date with nicky  leslie mann   who puts andy through the worst drunk  driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth  elizabeth banks   the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend .  br    br   things brighten up for andy when he meets trish  catherine keener   the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people . hmmm . and with that nice  looking collection of action figures  you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him  that is if he can ever  do the deed .   br    br   at last  this is the sex romp we  ve been waiting for . it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through  not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let  s look at the big picture how many of us  lonely guys  want to be a lonely guy forever  the important thing we  re taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself . i don  t think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does  which is side  splitting to be honest  and according to this website and various other news articles  was in fact real  and so was the blood on carell  s shirt afterward  .  br    br    the   year  old virgin  was directed by judd apatow and co  written by himself and carell  which originated as a skit that starred carell . carell is sweet and human  as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut . this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i  ve ever seen and is not offensive  a whole lot  because its characters are treated with dignity and respect . even carell  s buddies  who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities  can be related to on a fundamental level .  br    br   the way  the   year  old virgin  plays out is indeed funny in the end  but i  ll leave that up to you  the viewer  to observe . surely  if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener  then it  s true it is never too late   br    br         ': 216,\n",

       " 'another fantastic film from a country  where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes  has no problems in creating passionate subject matter . panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing  non  professional cast . while still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country  he does so without the need of a heavy storyline . it is a positive take on a country  in particular its people  that the iranian population desperately need . the greatest pity is it won  t be released domestically . the insular  paranoid iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them . after growing up amid revolution and watching the academics  artists and educated  disappear  over the last   years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there . the realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event . the fact he shot it on   mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format . it looks fantastic . his insistence in only using non  professional actors also really works in this film . fine performances all round . after watching many films showing the problems iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government . this film does the opposite . it shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isn  t too far away . some call panahi a feminist film maker but i think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in iran . young  independent women .

film . the sets and are excellent when we get to them  and there are some startling images  but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards . . .  br    br   much the best drama of the piece is in the mid  section  and then it plays as melodrama  arising from the  high concept  science  fiction nature of it all  and insufficiently robust dialogue . there is far more human life in this part though  with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over  the  top as the small dictator  the  boss  of the everytown . i loved richardson  s mannerisms and curt delivery of lines  dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond massey  s aloof  confident visitor . this boss is a posturing  convincingly deluded figure  unable to realise the small  fry nature of his kingdom . . . it  s not a great role  yet richardson makes a lot of it .  br    br   everytown itself is presumably meant to be england  or at least an english town fairly representative of england . interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the  things to come  seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal  but to just go on and on . there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section  concerning more personal  life   yet one is left quite unsatisfied . the film hasn  t got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle  blunt moralism  every time . and  of course  recall the hedged  bet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are   br    br   concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say it  s not at all bad as such  considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right . the grander conceptions have something to them a war in      well that was perhaps predictable . . . lasting nearly   years  mind   a nuclear bomb  the  super gun  or some such contraption  in     . . . a technocratic socialist  we don  t believe in independent nation states   type government  in britain  after     . . . hmmm  sadly nowhere near on that one  chaps     no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable anti  war sentiment . generally  it is assumed that dictatorship  whether boneheaded  luddite  fascist  as under the boss  or all  hands  to  the  pump scientific socialism  will be the deal  and these implications are not broached . . . while we must remember that in      there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out  or even how they were turning out  the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers  vision on other matters .  br    br   much of the earlier stuff should  and could  have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from       would have been necessary  yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous  and it is ages before we get to the richardson  massey parts . i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott who is just a trifle sceptical  cutting a flashing  eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose . the character is not explored  or frankly explained or exploited  except for one scene which i shall not spoil  and her relationship with the boss isn  t explored but then this was the     s  and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then . edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap  praying for war  only to be bluntly put down by another massey character . massey himself helps things a lot  playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto  contrasting well with a largely diffident cast  save for richardson  and scott and chapman  slightly .  br    br   i would say that  things to come  is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in      one of the few serious british science fiction films to date  indeed  its set  piece  design and harnessing of resources are ravenous  marvellous .  br    br   yet  the script is ultimately over  earnest and  at times  all over the place . the direction is prone to a flatness  though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion . the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology  and an engaging  jerky performance that consistently beguiles . such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this  they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers  great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate .  br    br    things to come   as it stands  is an intriguing oddity  well worth perusing  yet far short of a  metropolis  . . .  tis much as  silly   in wells  words  as that lang film  yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it .

       " 'what does the marquis de sade have to do with egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults  tobe hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film .  br    br   genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in alexandria  egypt . genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker  and blatant lesbian  who services daddy on the side . daddy gets sent back to the site  where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it . genie meets a descendant of the marquis de sade  and falls for a hunky egyptian  providing the film  s hottest scenes  . eventually  genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going . wrapped around this story is footage of the marquis de sade in prison  talking to a portrait of what looks like genie .  br    br   robert englund is terrific as both the marquis and his descendant . his acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements  so he is allowed to shine here . his best performance is still in  killer tongue   if you have not seen that yet .  br    br   the rest of the cast  including young genie  are pretty and average . the script  however  is problematic . you will quickly learn that the marquis scenes are completely unnecessary  except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set . the mermaid cult that eventually saves genie makes no sense whatsoever . who the mermaid is is never explained  and its link to christianity  which is hyped throughout the film  is nothing . the film is very anti  christian  as the archaeologist is a bible spouting father  but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute . there are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence  but hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say . i know i have no idea .  br    br   so why am i recommending this film  it is weird . there is an extended sex scene . for the ladies  hunky egyptian rides a horse completely nude . englund is marvelous . do you like snakes  this film is full of them . this is like roger corman with a bigger budget . knowing hooper somehow came up with  crocodile  after this is rather sad .  night terrors  is not perfect  but definitely worth a winking  unserious look .  br    br   this is rated  r  for physical violence  some sexual violence  gore  profanity  female nudity  male nudity  sexual content  sexual references  and drug abuse .  br    br    ': 593,\n",

       " 'red eye starts in texas where hotel receptionist lisa reisert  rachel mcadams  is about to catch the last  red eye  flight back to miami where she lives  works . while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome  charming jackson rippner  cillian murphy   they both seem to hit it off  then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other . once the plane takes off  they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is  that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence  jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary charles keefe  jack scalia   they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami . jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel  make it happen or her father will be killed . . .  br    br   directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left        a nightmare on elm street        the serpent and the rainbow        the people under the stairs        the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short  punchy  fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes . the script by carl ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed  at only   odd minutes in length it  s a very quick moving  economical  straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight  taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots . some may like this approach like i did while other  s may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick  fast without the film slowing down any  giving you a chance to relax . i really liked the plot for red eye  sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell  it  s a film made to entertain  for me that  s what it did . i really liked the two central character  s  lisa comes across as very likable while jackson rippner  an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the ripper  is a suitably slimy villain with a cold  i  m only doing my job  type mentality . another plus point is that i didn  t think anyone behaved overly stupid here  everyone actually seemed like human beings  the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion . i really liked this  it  s one of craven  s better more recent films .  br    br   craven turns in a good solid tense  tight  taught  fast paced thriller with an attractive cast  some good action  a gripping plot . he certainly doesn  t hang about  once he starts the action  tension he never lets up  far  away the most effective part of the film is when rippner is holding lisa hostage on the plane  once the film switches to miami  lisa  s fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it  s still good . a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this  i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it  looks drop dead stunning . those who see wes craven  s name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since there  s no horror in it at all  despite the imdb listing  horror  as red eye  s genre  . i am not sure about the ending  on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some way .  br    br   dreamworks apparently gave red eye an initial budget of            but reduced it to            although it  s still a very well made film with glossy production values . actually shot in los angeles  florida in california . the film was supposedly written with husband  wife sean penn  robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads . as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy  is a total babe in this  worth watching the film for on her own . oh   she puts in a decent performance too .  br    br   red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely  i didn  t think i would enjoy it as much as i did  i am glad i decided to watch it . this definitely gets a recommendation from me  rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this . . .

       " 'in rosenstrasse  margarethe von trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage . the film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter  and the story of german women who staged a protest on rosenstrasse to free their jewish husbands from certain extermination . in addition to the dramatization of historical events  the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the holocaust by a german and the result of the child  s experience of losing her mother . while ms . von trotta shows that the courage of a small number of germans made a difference  she does not use it to excuse german society . indeed  she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination  the wealthy artists and intellectuals of german high society went on about their lives and parties  oblivious to the suffering .  br    br   rosenstrasse opens in new york as a jewish widow ruth weinstein  jutta lampe  decides to sit shiva  a seven  day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased . when her daughter hannah  maria schrader   is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fianc luis  fedja van huet   a non  jew  hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an orthodox tradition that she previously rejected . when ruth coldly rejects her cousin  hannah questions her and learns about a woman named lena who took ruth in as a child when the latter  s mother was deported and murdered by the nazis  and she vows to find lena and discover the secret of her mother  s past .  br    br   her quest takes her to berlin where she finds lena  doris schade   now ninety years old  and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the holocaust . with unfailing memory  lena tells her story of how  as a young    year old woman  katja reimann   she searched for her husband  jewish pianist fabian israel fischer  martin feifel   who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given jews in mixed marriages . lena  in a radiant performance by reimann  discovers that her husband and other jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the rosenstrasse .  br    br   standing together in the freezing night  german women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building  their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting  give us back our husbands  . lena finds ruth  svea lohde   a young girl whose mother is in the building . she takes care of her  protecting her from the gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed . lena comes from an aristocratic german family and her brother  recently returned from stalingrad  is a wehrmacht officer . after being refused help from her father to free fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow officer   i know what they do to the jews . i saw it  . given his support  she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the minister of culture  joseph goebbels  a known womanizer . while this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters  it is a historical fact that goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting rosenstrasse .  br    br   the director margarethe von trotta  an activist  feminist  and intellectual  is no stranger to political drama . she directed a film about socialist rosa luxembourg and marianne and julianne  a story of the relationship between two sisters  one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives . in rosenstrasse  a film she worked on for eight years  she had to make compromises  adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced . that it works so well is a tribute to ms . von trotta  s artistry and the beautiful screenplay by pamela katz whose father was a refugee from leipzig . the events at rosenstrasse give the lie to germans  who say   there was nothing we could do  . now von trotta has shown the opposite to be true  that something could be done to resist the nazis . it is tragic that the example did not catch on .

    "# Project 5: Making our Network More Efficient<a id='project_5'></a>\n",
    "**TODO:** Make the `SentimentNetwork` class more efficient by eliminating unnecessary multiplications and additions that occur during forward and backward propagation. To do that, you can do the following:\n",
    "* Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.\n",
    "* Remove the `update_input_layer` function - you will not need it in this version.\n",
    "* Modify `init_network`:\n",
    ">* You no longer need a separate input layer, so remove any mention of `self.layer_0`\n",
    ">* You will be dealing with the old hidden layer more directly, so create `self.layer_1`, a two-dimensional matrix with shape 1 x hidden_nodes, with all values initialized to zero\n",
    "* Modify `train`:\n",
    ">* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`. This will help with the next step.\n",
    ">* At the beginning of the function, you'll want to preprocess your reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review. This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1. Your code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer`\n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.\n",
    ">* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.\n",
    "* Modify `run`:\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer` \n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* Much like you did in `train`, you will need to pre-process the `review` so you can work with word indices, then update `layer_1` by adding weights for the indices used in the review."

# Udacity_DeepLearning_ND
This Repository Contains my work going through the Deep Learning NanoDegree and any related materials that I completed in route to completing the NanoDegree.


The Main Projects in the NanoDegree are:
  1. My first Neural Network
  2. Dog Project 
  3. Script Generation 
  4. Face Generation (Not Yet Compeleted) 
  5. Teach a Quadcopter to fly (Not yet Completed)
